# Models

Scripts to train and test the models (ASR, summarization and cascade)

The train_*.sh files can also evaluate the model. Comment/Uncomment the line "--eval" to change this behaviour.

## Content

**Folders**:

* wav2vec2_log : some logs from the scripts for wav2vec2
* wav2vec2_logs : training logs from wav2vec2 (name due to merging the local version with Aachen version)
* pegasus_log : some logs from the scripts for Pegaus
* pegasus_logs : training logs from Pegaus (name due to merging the local version with Aachen version)
